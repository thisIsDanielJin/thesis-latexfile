Much like a telephone number, an IP address is assigned to every network interface (router, computer, mobile telephone, server, etc.) that connects to the Internet. These addresses are currently assigned using the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, or IPv4. There are a limited number of addresses that can be assigned using IPv4 and the supply of unallocated addresses is effectively exhausted. This paper (i) identifies key facts and challenges arising from IPv4 address scarcity; (ii) outlines and analyzes potential responses to IPv4 scarcity; and (iii) concludes that a decisive transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is the most durable and effective response to the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses resulting from the growth of the global Internet and the exploding demand for IP addresses.}

NAT64 is one such bridging mechanism by which a network allows IPv6-only clients to connect to the entire Internet, leveraging DNS to identify IPv4-only networks, inject IPv6 response addresses pointing to an internal gateway, and seamlessly translate connections. To date, our understanding of NAT64 deployments is limited; what little information exists is largely qualitative, taken from mailing lists and informal discussions.},

In this paper, both the performance and the stability of two NAT64 gateway implementations are examined by ICMP, TCP and UDP protocols. The tested two free implementations, the TAYGA on the Linux system and the PF of the OpenBSD system can be effectively used in a production environment, and can facilitate the deployment of the IPv6 protocol.}
