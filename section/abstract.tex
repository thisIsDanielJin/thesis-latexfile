\section*{Abstract}
IPv4 address exhaustion has accelerated the shift toward IPv6-first networks that must still maintain reachability to IPv4-only services. While Dual-Stack remains the prevailing deployment model, translation-based designs, NAT64 with DNS64 and client-side translation via CLAT as in 464XLAT, offer an alternative that can reduce IPv4 dependency. This thesis quantifies the performance trade-offs between Dual-Stack and CLAT by measuring TCP throughput and ICMP round-trip time (RTT) under realistic Linux implementations and topologies. Three translators: Jool (kernel-space SIIT/NAT64), Tayga (stateless user space), and Tundra (multi-threaded user space SIIT/CLAT), were evaluated across three environments: an AWS setup, a bare-metal Ubuntu host, and a bare-metal network connected via Ethernet. The experiments used Linux network namespaces to control topology and isolate components and included native IPv6 baselines with one and two hops to separate hop-count effects from translation cost.
The results show that CLAT introduces only a small performance overhead relative to Dual-Stack for the tested workloads. When the host datapath was the bottleneck, Jool consistently delivered higher throughput and lower RTT than the user-space translators, reflecting reduced context switches and copy overheads in the kernel datapath. When a 1 Gbit/s physical link bounded performance, differences among translators compressed toward the link limit and the gap to Dual-Stack largely disappeared. Platform timing effects were significant: virtualization jitter and clocksource selection (kvm-clock, hpet, tsc) measurably influenced time series smoothness and reported rates, highlighting the need to interpret results relative to same-clock baselines. Overall, the findings support CLAT as a viable choice for IPv6-first deployments where IPv4 addresses are scarce or costly. The study focuses on single-flow TCP and ICMP and leaves CPU cost, tail latency, DNS behavior, and container-orchestrated environments to future work.
